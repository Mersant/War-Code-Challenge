```
Two superpowers face off, their nuclear arsenals primed for mutual annihilation. With the fateful command of "War!", subterranean silos unleash Armageddon, ICBMs crossing continents to unleash catastrophic fire. Missile meets missile in blinding flashes, entire cities engulfed in mushroom clouds as civilizations burn. Some weapons find their targets, decimating enemy bases in radioactive fireballs. Others are intercepted and fall impotent. Stockpiles dwindle with each apocalyptic exchange, but neither side will yield. In the end, none can claim victory upon this charred earth. Such is the nature of nuclear war, a conflict purging all life in its thermonuclear inferno. Where no valor survives and hopes evaporate in atomic fury. A game of unchecked escalation, ending only in extinction.

## Running
Executables were compiled on windows. If you need to compile them yourself, ensure you have a C++ compiler installed. There are a few to choose from, though I use the GNU Compiler Collection. (GCC) To install GCC on Windows, [use this guide.](https://dev.to/gamegods3/how-to-install-gcc-in-windows-10-the-easier-way-422j) Mac users can install GCC by following [this guide](https://osxdaily.com/2023/05/02/how-install-gcc-mac/) though it may be easier to just use Clang. (Run "xcode-select --install" in your terminal and install the command line tools. You can then "use" GCC even though behind the scenes you're really just using Apple's Clang compiler.)

After you have the proper compiler installed, use it to compile mainNoFlavorText.cpp or mainWithFlavorText.cpp. mainWithFlavorText is far more interesting so you should probably do that one. For GCC, the command to do this would be
```
g++ mainNoFlavorText.cpp -o War
```
Then run it on Mac in Terminal or on Windows in PowerShell by running:
```
./War
```
